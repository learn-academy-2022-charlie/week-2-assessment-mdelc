# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is used as a placeholder in a function to represent the type of value that will be input, or the argument. The argument is the actual value that will be used for the function to return the new value.

  Researched answer: There are two kinds of parameters, input and output/return parameters. Input parameters pass values into the functions. The function parameters are named to easily identify what kind of value will be input. An argument is the true value that will pass through the function when called.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The predefined parameters in the .map() method are array, value, and index. One of the three are required for the built-in method to work.

  Researched answer: The .map() built in method requires a function and current value parameter. The function will be run to each of the array elements (current (value =>) of element). The index, array, and this.value are optional parameters that hold the value of current element.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map() iterates through all the values of the array to assign new value while .filter() goes through the existing values and outputs the ones that are called.

  Researched answer: .map() is a built in method that converts each values of the array. This is a faster method than using for loops. It creates new arrays by performing task of function to each element in array.

  .filter() is also a built in method, however, it selects specific elements within the array. It returns a filtered array as opposed to updating the current array.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A method is built into JavaScript already while a function is created and implemented.

  Researched answer: Functions are called using the parenthesis syntax and can be called on their own to perform a task. They can also be reused and called anywhere.

  A method is a property of an object like a class. It's also a set of instructions, however, it is associated with a specific object.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is a way to access the values within an object as a shortcut.

  Researched answer: In JavaScript, destructuring uses the data in the object to assign them to new variables. We're able to get multiple properties from an array at a time. This way we're able to assign values quickly from propery name in an object.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting can be used to build upon functions in Javascript.

  Researched answer: Hoisting is a way JavaScript allows code to be easily used before they're officially declared. Hoisting can be used with variables, functions, or classes. Variables and classes can at times still have undefined's while function hoisting is more commonly used. It will put it above prior to the function being carried out.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Class Inheritance is when you take a previously created class (the parent) and build off of that to create a new child class that "inherits" properties from the parent class.

2. React: React was created for webpages to be scalable and to have pages reload quickly. It consists of JS code in a library to be used for better user experience.

3. React state: React state is an object to store property values. It appears in the constructor method and enables the management of changing data in an application.

4. React lifecycle methods: The lifecycle consists of mounting, updating, and unmounting. Or in layman's terms: birth, growth, and death of the component.

5. DOM: Document Object Model interface that allows JS or other programs to change style, set up and content of a web page.
